# joplin2notion

A bunch of one off scripts to migrate a collection of Markdown files from a Joplin export to Notion. Feel free to use as inspiration if you're doing the same thing.

There's also `duplicates.js` to check for duplicates in a DB based on title or (normalized) URL.

Code mostly written by Claude.

## Usage

1. `npm install`
2. `node <script>.js`
